These files need to be loaded into the production database by a superuser level role
(such as postgres) then dump the DB before loading the rest of the initial schema files 
like normal migrations.

The 008 file needs to be adjusted to set the owner to the primary database user.

In the same manner the tablefunc.sql contrib file needs to be loaded.

    * psql -qXf /usr/share/pgsql/contrib/tablefunc.sql <dbname>
