General

- Improve use of IC::Config to allow for registering a config module to be used
  so that subclassing may be used to override all functionality
- Build dependency list

Manage Area

- Move pulling in of YUI CSS files as part of manage/index.tst into combo handling from YUI_config
- Eliminate pre-determined application structure in DOM, let manage.js build it
- Set ID of application-loading node into configuration and then only remove it when necessary
- Basically reduce as much as possible that is required in the html for the manage app
- Pull the manage app out into a standalone project
