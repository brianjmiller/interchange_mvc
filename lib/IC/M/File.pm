=begin rationale

    Storage Rationale:

    Decided on /uncontrolled/<table>/<pk>/<resource without table> because it seemed to be
    the best balance between human accessibility via the filesystem itself and facilitation
    of removal of all of the files associated with a given row in a table. Removal of a
    resource would be tedious in this case which seems the least likely to occur frequently.
    Removal or changing of a table name itself would still be trivial which may or may not
    be more likely than a resource removal.

    Other options:

    /uncontrolled/<resource>/<pk> - which amounts to /uncontrolled/<table>/<resource rest>/<pk>
    which is possibly the most human accessible but is a pain to remove files associated with
    a deleted record as it requires looping over the resources.

    /uncontrolled/files/<files.pk> - which is terribly inaccessible for humans, compounded by
    the fact that the directory index underneath "files/" would become overwhelming. Obviously
    it would be very easy to remove a single file, but would require looping to remove all files
    associated with a particular reference object.
