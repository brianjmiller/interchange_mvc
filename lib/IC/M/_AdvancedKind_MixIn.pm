#
# classes using this mixin should implement two methods:
#
#     _mixin_model_descriptor:
#
#       returns a name that can be used to identify the model being acted on
#
#     _get_change_kind_struct:
#
#       returns a structure that is a hash of hash refs where the keys of the 
#       outer hash represent statuses that an object is changing from, with 
#       the keys of the inner hash being statuses that an object is changing 
#       to whose value is callback subroutine to run when the transition occurs
